## Chat with a calendar assistant

Ever been handed a tiny reminder card after booking an appointment—at the dentist, a massage therapist, or even a pedicure—only to shove it in your pocket, promising yourself you'll add it to your digital calendar later? (And then... forget? 😅)

This chatbot solves this problem in seconds.

📸 How it works:

1️⃣ Launch the app on your phone (or computer), tap Choose File, and TAKE PHOTO of the reminder card.

2️⃣ Give the AI chatbot some quick instructions.

3️⃣ It extracts the appointment details, formats them properly, and shows a preview.

4️⃣ You can refine the results with chat, claryfying dates and times, adding or correcting a location, etc. Chat for as long as you want until the calendar items are exactly how you want them!

5️⃣ When satisfied, download a single calendar file. On phones, most phones will offer to add the appointments directly to your calendar with one tap! On computers, you will download the file then double click to open and process into your calendar.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar-helper-ai.git
   ```
2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key  # For Flask development server only
   DEBUG_LOGGING=false
   DEBUG_LOG_IMAGE=false
   OPENAI_HTTP_CLIENT_LEVEL=ERROR
   OPENAI_API_LEVEL=ERROR
   ```

   Note: The FLASK_SECRET_KEY is only used for securing Flask's development server. This application does not use server-side sessions or store any session data. You can generate a secure key using:
   ```bash
   python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))'
   ```

   Also, in development environments, you can enable logs to see much more information both in the server log as well as the browser logs.

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will be available at port 5000.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Main application interface
- `GET /api/config`: Get application configuration (version, max image size, allowed image types, debug settings)
- `POST /process`: Process image/text and generate events
- `POST /correct`: Apply corrections to existing events
- `POST /download-ics`: Generate and download iCalendar file

The `/api/config` endpoint is called automatically when the application loads to configure client-side validation and debugging. It returns:
- Maximum allowed image size
- List of allowed image types (jpg, png, etc.)
- Application version
- Debug logging settings

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for styling, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. The main workflow consists of:

1. **Initial Load**:
   - Fetches configuration from `/api/config`
   - Sets up event listeners for file upload and chat
   - Initializes UI components

2. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - Upload Section: Handles image uploads and initial text input
   - Processing Display: Shows loading states during API calls
   - Results Display: Renders extracted events in cards
   - Chat Interface: Enables real-time corrections through conversation
   - Calendar Download: Generates and downloads .ics files

3. **Key Features**:
   - Real-time image preview
   - Interactive chat for corrections
   - Dynamic event card updates
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Client-side validation for uploads

The UI maintains state in memory during the session and automatically clears after one hour of inactivity or when manually cleared by the user.
