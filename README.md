## Chat with a calendar assistant

Ever been handed a tiny reminder card after booking an appointment‚Äîat the dentist, a massage therapist, or even a pedicure‚Äîonly to shove it in your pocket, promising yourself you'll add it to your digital calendar later? (And then... forget? üòÖ)

This chatbot solves this problem in seconds.

üì∏ How it works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the app on your phone, tap Choose File, and TAKE PHOTO of the reminder card.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Give the AI chatbot some quick instructions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ It extracts the appointment details, formats them properly, and shows a preview.

4Ô∏è‚É£ You can refine the results with chat.

5Ô∏è‚É£ When satisfied, download a single calendar file‚Äîon most phones, the file will offer to add the appointments directly to your calendar with one tap!
