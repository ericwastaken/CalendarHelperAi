            <li>The calendar file is <strong>generated on-demand</strong> and is not retained on our servers after creation.  </li>
            <li>Your <strong>image is processed in server memory temporarily</strong> and displayed back to you via browser memory; it is <strong>not stored server-side</strong>.  </li>

            <li><strong>Request correction or deletion</strong> of any data we hold (note: as we do not store data beyond the session, no retained data exists after your session ends).  </li>
            <li><strong>Opt-out of data processing</strong> (California’s “Do Not Sell My Data” rule does not apply, as we do not store or sell data).  </li>
